# digiDaruma
Darumas are those cute roly-poly dolls which represent the courage to start towards a new goal, the perseverance required to achieve a goal, and the glory of achievement felt afterwards.


This is a personal project, but I am open to assistance. If you spot anything in the area of Issues, improvements, or inspirations, speak up.
